axesHelper is typical like in math or physics the cartesian coordinate system, where goes x y and z axels

this is very helpful tool, because of creating or adding some geometry material like box, cube, circle or donuts materials of the scene,
you will be known of material size where it does going 

it'll be added in scription of javascript or in js file with others materials

add the coordinates and will show up, the number means of the size, its default number is 1

var axesHelper = new THREE.AxesHelper( 500 );
scene.add( axesHelper );
